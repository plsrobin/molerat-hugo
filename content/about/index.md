We are a group of 3 young adults working to make server hosting easy and affordable. Before Molerat, hosting digital infrastructure has been part of our everyday lives. We've been dissapointed countless times by hosting services both overpriced and underperforming.

So we created Molerat; to bring fair pricing and performance to the communities we love!

The team conssists of:
- Robin - Our server guy
- Viking - The Bussniessman
- Max - The marketeer
